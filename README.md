# ActivityLifiCycleExample
Activity life cyle example callbacks.

As Android developers we inevitably have to learn about the activity lifecycle and how it works. Its important that we know
which states our activities go through when a user navigates through our app, out of it or back into it, so we can do the 
right operations at the right time and avoid crashes and other bugs. For this reason we want to take a closer look at the 
activity lifecycleof its 7 main callbacks: onCreate, onStart, onResume, onPause, onStop,
onDestroy and onRestart.
